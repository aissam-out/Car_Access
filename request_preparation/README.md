# Request preparation

After a user has checked out in the [Booking Portal](../Booking_Portal/), his information are stored in a MYSQL database.

Here we are about to prepare these scattered data and formulate them as a _get_access()_ request that will be received by the PEP.

Optionally, we can also store the result in the _requests.csv_ file.
