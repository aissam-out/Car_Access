# Car_Access

The IoT is growing by leaps and bounds, thus creating this large, smart and autonomous system requiring less and less human intervention. Smart city (SC) was always the case in point that portrays this vision where devices not only interact but depend on (even control) each other. 

## Car booking portal

The interface on which a client can book a car. It contains a catalog of available cars, a machine learning engine to extract text (mainly ID number) from ID card as well as the other building blocs responsible for the checkout.

## Extract text from image

After the user scan his ID card, this API allow us to extract the ID number from it.

## Data generation

- Generate _"empower"_ dataset : mapping **subjects** to **roles**

- Generate _"use"_ dataset : mapping **objects** to **views**

- Generate _"PAP"_ dataset : mapping **(org, role, view, activity, context)** to **(decision, proba)**

- Two scripts : _"consider"_ and _"checkContext"_ to get the abstract entities for **actions** and **contexts** respectively

## Policy Enforcement Point

A policy enforcement point (PEP) is a component that serves as the gatekeeper and "front door" to a digital resource. The PEP receives, formulates and transfers clients' requests to the PDP.

Basically, in our implementation, the Booking Portal and request preparation folders are parts of the PEP.

## Policy Information Point

Policy information point (a.k.a. PIP) is the system entity that acts as a source of attribute values. It contains the dataset/rules matching each concreate entity -subject, object, action, context- with its abstract category -role, view, activity, Context (respectively)-

On top of these datasets/rules, our PIP provides a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) based web framework able to receive _matching_ requests from the PDP using JSON format.

## Policy Administation Point

The policy administration point (PAP) is the interface or tool that enables you to create, edit and store digital policies or rules.

> _FLASK, PANDAS_

## Policy Decision Point

The policy decision point (PDP) is the component of access control system that decides whether or not to authorize a userâ€™s request, based on available information from the PIP and security policies from the PAP.

This implementation provides an extra feature : In case the received request contains fields the system have never dealt with, the PDP predicts the answer based on machine learning algorithms ([Catboost](https://catboost.ai/) in our case).

> _CATBOOST_

## Learning

This fonctionnality consists of three features : 

* _Dynamicity_ : The probabilities of how the safe experience is (or will be) are statically stored in the PAP. This feature offers the possibilty to update them based on previous experiences.

* _Exploration_ : This property consits of exploring extra new features to encrease the accuracy of future predictions.

* _Differential Privacy_ : Enable organizations to collaborate while preserving their privacy using a random response implementation of DF.

## The overall architecture

As a CRA, our organization is mainly composed of selfdriving cars (decomposed into two views: luxury and normal cars); its customers are generally normal clients, VIP clients or blacklisted ones (which makes respectively three roles: NC, VIP, BC); regarding the activities it is more realistic to categorize them by rental period (a1: 1 day, a2: between 1 and 3 days, and a3: more than 3 days). Finally, the context represents the time of the year during which the request is made: is it a peak season (peak) like summer for example, or off season (off).
