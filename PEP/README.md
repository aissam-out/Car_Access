# Policy Enforcement Point

A policy enforcement point (a.k.a. PEP) is a component that serves as the gatekeeper and "front door" to a digital resource. The PEP receives, formulates and transfers clients' requests to the PDP.

Basically, in our implementation, the Booking Portal and request preparation folders are parts of the PEP.
